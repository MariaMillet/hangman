# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 2
Basic Python commands implemented to write a programme to check the user input is a single albhabetic character.

## Milestone 3
This code is an extension of the previous code, with the key change being a continuous loop for the user input until the condition is satisfied.
